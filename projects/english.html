    <h2>Hug by Pablo Neruda</h2>
    <p>A simple hug softens our hearts;
        welcomes us and makes life more bearable.
        
        A hug is a way of sharing joys
        as well as the sad moments that come our way.
        
        It is just a way of saying to our friends
        that we love them and that we care about each other
        because hugs were made to give to those who we love.
        
        A hug is an amazing action.
        It is the perfect way to show the love we feel
        When we don’t get the right word.
        
        It is wonderful because just a hug given with lots of love,
        makes feel good to who we give it to, regardless the place or language
        because it is always understood.
        
        For these, and for many more reasons…
        Today, I send you my warmest hug.</p>
