    <p>My love for you is greater than you can even imagine. There’s so much I love about you, the way you love for me will always make me love you. 
        You’re my best friend, there's no one else I can talk to the way I talk to you. 
        Calling you makes my day everyday whether I show it or not, I could talk and look at you for hours and i’m so glad we have our talks again. 
        I can tell you anything no matter how weird/cancelable it is. Talking to you makes my day more than you know.
         You're such a good person, you're the most humble, caring, kind person I know. 
         I love how you’ll always do stuff with me even if you don’t want to and I’ll always love you for that. 
         I can’t wait to play you in basketball and imma be pooping on you and you won’t want to play but you still will. 
         There’s so many small things I love about you.  I love the way you breathe into the mic, I love the way you eat, I love the way you drink I love hearing u gulp,
          I love your smile how contagious it is it warms my heart, I love how you stand and walk, I love how u lick your lips, I love how u blow me kisses, I love how supportive you are, 
          I love how kind and caring you are, I love how funny you are, I love how high you raise your legs to take off ur pants, 
          I love how you take care of your nephew there’s no one else I’d want to be the mother of my kids (not saying have kids now). 
          There’s so many reasons why I love you, those are just a couple of reasons why.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>One big reason is there’s no one I can be my full self with. I'm so comfortable with you and you're so accepting I'm able to act how I want and I love you for that.</h3>
