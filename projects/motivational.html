        <p>Never meant someone who inspires me to be great as much as you do. You’re the reason I wanna be good at everything I do. I always wanna impress you. 
            I do good in basketball to be able to go home to you to be able to show you my clips. 
            I get good at coding to be able to impress you and make stuff like this for you and in the future I’ll be able to create bigger and better things for you. 
            I wanna be great at coding to be able to be rich like you and take care of. You going to the gym all the time motivates me more than you know, it shows me so much discipline that I wanna have and how mentally strong you are and now I'm working to be able to have discipline just like you. 
            I wanna be able to go and do something that’s good for me even if I feel like dogshit. One of my goals is to become disciplined because of you. 
            Lately you’ve had a lot on your plate but you still keep going, you still show up to work, still go to the gym, still show up to class (sometimes), 
            still be the best gf ever to me and that’s so inspiring. You wanting to be a doctor and you choosing that path motivates me to be great with my education too. 
            That’s part of the reason I chose such a hard major, I wanna do something as hard as your major to be able to work on my discipline and be smart like you and this skill of coding is perfect for me. 
            Overall I wanna let you know that all the things you do don’t go unnoticed they inspire me more than you know keep being you no matter what. 
        </p>
