        <h3 class="title">This page is dedicated to your beauty &hearts;</h3>
        <p>From the moment I laid eyes on you I was stunned. My first time seeing you I’ve never seen anyone like you before. 
            It's like you fell from heaven and I knew I needed you instantly.  Your beauty blew me away and I still get butterflies over 2 years later by just looking at you. 
            Your eyes sparkle like diamonds. I get lost in them everytime I see them. 
            There an addicting drug and I’m the biggest fein. I’m staring at them right now as I’m typing this and my words can’t even explain how beautiful they are.
            If I could look into your eyes for a living I’d drop every dream job and do that, I hope I’ll be able to stare into your eyes forever. 
            I love every part about you from your hair to your eyebrows to your nose to your lips and to your forehead that I wanna give a million kisses,too.
            I can't say enough about your smile either, it brings me so much joy. Seeing your smile when answering the phone makes my day everytime. 
            your smile lights up my world and clears any sadness in my mind.
            Your smile needs to be in a maxium security safe, it's so priceless and rare. No one has a more prettier smile than my girl.
